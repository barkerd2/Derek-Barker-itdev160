      <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p class="text">
   Louisiana Channel is a non-profit website based at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebæk, Denmark. With Louisiana Channel as a platform, Louisiana provides culture to the Internet, extending beyond the museum’s own events. The Louisiana team produces videos about art and culture on an ongoing basis. New videos are posted at the site every week.

   Louisiana Channel contributes to the permanent development of the museum as a cultural platform, expressing a desire to sharpen the understanding of the importance of culture and the arts. We see Louisiana Channel as an integral part of a museum for the 21st century, capable of engaging a new generation in our cultural heritage, in an intelligent present and an ambitious future.

   It has always been Louisiana’s role to stimulate discussion of society through the insights of art and artists, and the same goes for Louisiana Channel.

   <h3>Review:</h3>
   <p class="text">
   The Louisiana Channel provides an invaluable resource for artist interviews and insite directly from artists themselves. These interviews provide an an accurate account of their processes, experiences and interactions with the world at large. The Louisiana Channel based at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebæk, Denmark aligns itself with the acidemic and the musem spaces that focus on teh visual arts. Whats offerd is a resource for artists to stay current with whats being done and exhubited in the visual arts space as well as to introduce new or under-recognized artists. This is an art for artsists  space and the general public can gain some profund insight into what makes art tick.

   <h3>Review:</h3>
   <p class="text">
   Blouin Art Info reaches a mostly afflunet audience interested in severeal arts disciplines as well as the the retal market and travel destinations to experience the arts. It accomplishes its job as a glossy high level view of the art world in general, while many of the events and destinations are out of the reach of many of us the space reads like the Vouge magazine of the art world.

   <h3>Review:</h3>
   <p>
Art 21 has been a long favorite of mine as it easily accessable and rigourous enogh to keep art world veterns interested, this is the best entry point for anyone interested in learning more about contemporary art as it looks at today while applying historicle context and never discounts whats come before for the sake of whats the newest trend in art its associations with PBS-broadcasting provides credibility and integrity that seeks to educate and circumvent the "gate-keeperisms" of teh contemporary art world.
