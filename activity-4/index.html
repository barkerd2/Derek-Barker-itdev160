      <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>The squeegee is typically used in screen printing as it either pulls or pushes ink through a fine mesh stencil that registers on a substrate such as paper or fabric.
Squeegees are measured by durometer  which is the rigidity of the plastic or urethane blade which is seated inside a handle. Durometer scale ranges from 60 being softest to 80 being the hardest in regards to the use of this tool.</p>

   <h3>Review:</h3>
   <p>
   I got my hands on the Speedball version of this tool and at first glance i could tell that it was well crafted, the blade was seated snugly in the wood handle with no gap and adhered to it with two part epoxy as opposed to staples which I’ve seen in some lower cost brands.
with its initial use I could tell that the pine handle was properly weighted and milled to be comfortable during operation and that the blade had no unusual hesitation when being pulled over the screen as some other brands that do not have well seated blades tend to.

      <h2>Speedball Block printing brayer</h2>

      <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>The brayer is a tool that is used in both  monoprinting, linocut and lithography it is used to apply ink evenly in some instances and registration in others. The brayer is composed of a roller of either hard or soft rubber of a specific durometer which sits on an axle that is attached to a handle.</p>

   <h3>Review:</h3>
   <p>
I tested both ink application and registration. Speedball is the manufacturer of the product used for this review.
Monoprinting is fairly straight forward and can be done two ways apply ink to an object and press it against paper / fabric or ink a copper plate and place an object into the inked plate. Where this gets tricky is in the application of ink, it need to be a smooth even application with the proper ink weight to get a good print.
Some brayers have a roller that is pinned in by the handle at either end as opposed to and axel that goes all the way through which can lead to poor distribution of ink sticking during work and un even pressure during registration. Again Speedball has produce a well crafted tool, made up of a steel axle that goes all the way through the roller with urethane grommets to keep it centered.
The application of ink is even with no sticking or hesitation the urethane grommets allowed me to gauge the speed and force of application and registration amounting to some really detailed print work.

      <h2>Richeson Twisted Etching Tool</h2>

      <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>Etching tools are typically needles some are steel points seated in a wooden handle and some solid pieces of machined steel sharpened to a point. An etching tool is used in conjunction with a zinc plate which performs the registration, etching is nether additive or subtractive it is a process of displacement of material that creates and image. The tool is held firmly like a pencil at time and at other like a knife the soft nature of zinc allows it be scored just below its surface the material is displace from the score creating a burl this burling effect helps to determine light and darks during registration as ink is rubbed into the score and burl and then picked up by a paper substrate during printing.</p>

   <h3>Review:</h3>
   <p>
The Richeson etching tool that i picked up from Blick is piece of solid machined steel twisted and sharped at both end to different degrees. As etching tools go solid steel tends to cost more but has little to no give when cutting into a zinc plate this one was no different with the exception of it precision machining its sharpened end offer no stuttering as it scored and its composition of high quality steel offered no give against the softer metal creating nice burls that are sure to allow a good number of prints before they begin to break down.
